# CycleGAN for BDD Day and Night Images

This repository contains an ongoing implementation of **CycleGAN** for image translation tasks, specifically designed for the **BDD (Berkeley DeepDrive) dataset**. The goal is to train a CycleGAN model to translate images between day and night scenes. The current implementation includes the base structure for training and inference.
